printer names        - enumerates the locally installed printers

printer print        - creates a job and prints lines of text on the one or more pages.
                       The command
                           printer print -name $printer $text
                       is a shortcat for
                           set p [printer open -name $printer]
                           $p start
                           $p startpage
                           while true {
                               set text [string range $text [$p print $text] end]
                               if {[string length $text]} {
                                   $p endpage
                                   $p startpage
                               } else {
                                   break
                           }
                           $p endpage
                           $p end
                           $p close
printer open         - opens an interface to the printer, gdi or raw
    -default         - opens default printer
    -select          - executes printer selection dialog
    -name printername- the name of the specific output device being used, as shown by the Print Manager (for example, Epson FX-80)

gdicommand start     -  starts a print job.
    -document documentname - the name of the document.
    -output outputfilename - the name of an output file. If not specified, the output will be sent to the printer device.

gdicommand end       - ends a print job.

gdicommand close     - deletes gdicommand.

gdicommand abort     - stops the current print job and erases everything drawn since the last call to the start. Deletes gdicommand!

gdicommand startpage - prepares the printer driver to accept data.

gdicommand endpage   - notifies the device that the application has finished writing to a page. This function is typically used to direct the device driver to advance to a new page.

gdicommand place     - draws formatted text in the specified rectangle and formats the text according to the specified method (expanding tabs, justifying characters, breaking lines, and so forth). If the function succeeds, the return value is the height of the text in device units. If vcenter or bottom align mode is specified, the return value is the offset from -rect top value to the bottom of the drawn text.
    -rect rectspec   - the rectangle (in device coordinates) in which the text is to be formatted.
        rectspect    - {?left? ?top? ?right? ?bottom?} - rectangle (in device coordinates) by default {0 0 pagewidth pageheight}.
    -align alignspec - the method of formatting the text
        alignspec    - {?value1? ?value2? ...}  - can be one or more of the following values:
            top             Justifies the text to the top of the rectangle.
            left            Aligns text to the left.
            center          Centers text horizontally in the rectangle.
            right           Aligns text to the right.
            vcenter         Centers text vertically.
            bottom          Justifies the text to the bottom of the rectangle.
            wordbreak       Breaks words. Lines are automatically broken between words if a word would extend past the edge of the rectangle specified by the -rect parameter. A carriage return-line feed sequence also breaks the line.
            singleline      Displays text on a single line only. Carriage returns and line feeds do not break the line.
            expandtabs      Expands tab characters. The number of characters per tab is eight. The wordellipsis, pathellipsis, and endellipsis values cannot be used with this value.
            noclip          Draws without clipping. 
            externalleading Includes the font external leading in line height. 
            pathellipsis    For displayed text, replaces characters in the middle of the string with ellipses so that the result fits in the specified rectangle. 
            wordellipsis    Truncates any word that does not fit in the rectangle and adds ellipses.
            endellipsis     For displayed text, if the end of a string does not fit in the rectangle, it is truncated and ellipses are added. If a word that is not at the end of the string goes beyond the limits of the rectangle, it is truncated without ellipses.
            top, bottom and vcenter are usable only with the singleline value.
    -font fontspec   - specified a logical font with the folollowing characteristics. 
        fontspec     - {?name? ?height? ?width? ?weight? ?style? ?charset? ?quality? ?pitch? ?family?}
            name - string that specifies the typeface name of the font.
            height - the height, in logical units, of the font's character cell or character.
            width - the average width, in logical units, of characters in the requested font. If this value is zero, the font mapper chooses a closest match value. 
            weight - the weight of the font in the range 0 through 1000. For example, 400 is normal and 700 is bold. If this value is zero, a default weight is used.
                The following values are defined for convenience:
                thin           100
                extralight     200
                ultralight     200

            quality - the output quality:
                antialiased     font is antialiased, or smoothed, if the font supports it and the size of the font is not too small or too large.
                default         appearance of the font does not matter.
                draft           appearance of the font is less important than when the proof value is used. 
                nonantialiased  font is never antialiased, that is, font smoothing is not done.
                proof           character quality of the font is more important than exact matching of the logical-font attributes.

BUGS

shell is broken if built using 'USE_TCL_STUBS=1 STATIC_BUILD=0'
static shell exports Tclprinter_Init

NOTES

Windows XP - несколько документов (заданий), можно выполнять последовательно (start/end) в рамках одного контекста (printer open)
Windows 7  - для каждого документа (задания), надо открывать новый контекст (printer open)

Wndows XP - StartDoc не срабатывает после AbortDoc (или после сбойного StartDoc)
Wndows 7 - StartDoc не срабатывает повторно (после Start/End)

Windows XP - start/printempty/end не создает выходного документа
Windows 7  - start/end - создает пустой выходной документ

Windows XP,7 -  -raw write не печатает если не задать имя задания (-document)
Windows XP,7 -  -raw -output надо задавать полным путем, иначе непонятно где открывает
